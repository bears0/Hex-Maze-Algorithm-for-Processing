# Hex Maze Algorithm for Processing

https://processing.org/
 
I created these programs a few years ago. The Maze program is based off of a tutorial by The Coding Train (YouTube)

The Hex Maze program is my implementation in a hex grid.

Feel free to use this code however you like

Press "s" in the Hex Maze program to start the animation.
You will need to install OBJExport by Jesse Louis-Rosenberg to run the square maze program unless you remove the OBJ export code.
